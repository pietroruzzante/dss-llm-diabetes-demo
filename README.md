## üß† Overview

This project presents a **Decision Support System (DSS)** for **Type 1 Diabetes (T1D)** management, built around a **local Large Language Model (LLM)** that analyzes real-time patient data and provides **personalized therapeutic recommendations**.

Unlike conventional clinical decision tools, this DSS leverages **digital twin simulations** ‚Äî virtual patient replicas based on physiological models ‚Äî to **evaluate and validate** therapeutic advice safely and objectively.

The system is designed for **integration into mobile or cloud-based healthcare platforms**, enabling scalable, AI-assisted diabetes care that is both **clinically grounded** and **technologically robust**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture

The DSS follows a modular architecture based on three main layers:

1. **Data Acquisition**  
   - Receives real-time patient data (e.g., CGM glucose, insulin delivery, meals, physical activity).  
   - Compatible with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices following international standards (ISPAD/ADA).
   - An adaptive system is responsible for keeping memory of the past decisions made by the LLM for automatic CR/CF parameters adjusting

2. **Decision Layer (LLM Core)**

   - The DSS incorporates clinical reasoning based on:
      - **ISPAD 2022 Guidelines** ‚Äî Insulin therapy, glycemic targets, and pediatric diabetes management.  
      - **ADA Standards of Care** ‚Äî Self-management protocols and glucose goals.  
      - **Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP)** metrics ‚Äî used to evaluate time-in-range (TIR), hypoglycemia, and variability.
     
   - Local LLM performs reasoning on patient context.  
   - Generates therapeutic suggestions (e.g., basal adjustment, bolus correction, carb ratio adaptation).  
   - Uses a domain-specific prompt structure and safety guardrails.
   
4. **Output**  
   - A second LLM summarizes first LLM's reasoning for providing a brief and clear explanation to the patient.
   - Guardrails layer is responsible for detecting anomalous or dnagerous answers from the LLM and correcting them

## Evaluation of performance
This project introduces a **closed-loop validation** using **digital twins**, allowing not only to *evaluate* AI decisions but also to *simulate their physiological impact*.
Performances have been evaluated on 480 glucose traces, within the *ReplayBG* framework, exploiting the concept of digital twin.

**Innovation highlights:**
- First DSS prototype to combine **LLMs** with **in-silico clinical validation**.  
- Enables safe experimentation and reinforcement of therapeutic reasoning.  
- Demonstrates **causal efficacy** of AI recommendations on virtual glucose traces.  
- Bridges the gap between **AI interpretability** and **clinical reliability**.

## üß© Technical Implementation

- **Framework:** Python, FastAPI, Docker  
- **Model:** Quantized local LLM (DeepSeek and Gemma family)
- **Digital Twin Simulation:** Based on the UVA/Padova T1D Simulator and ReplayBG
- **Evaluation Metrics:** ŒîTIR and hypoglycemia events
- **Visualization:** Automated Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP) generation

## üìà Validation Through Digital Twins

To assess the clinical validity of LLM-generated decisions, a digital twin of each patient was simulated under different therapy scenarios:

| Scenario | Description | median TIR (Time in Range) |
|-----------|--------------|----------------------|
| Baseline | Standard clinical treatment | 63.93% |
| LLM Recommendation | Therapy adapted by DSS | 68.54% (+4.61%) |

> üß™ Results show that the DSS consistently improved glucose control metrics across virtual cohorts, demonstrating **measurable physiological benefit**.

## üí° Business & Integration Potential

This DSS represents a **turnkey innovation opportunity** for MedTech and digital health companies:

- ü©∫ **Clinical Reliability** ‚Äî built on validated ISPAD/ADA guidelines.  
- üì± **Integration-Ready** ‚Äî deployable as a backend API for mobile apps or wearable systems.  
- üîí **Privacy by Design** ‚Äî runs locally, without cloud dependency.  
- ‚ö° **Scalable Evaluation** ‚Äî supports rapid testing of AI strategies through digital twin simulation.  
- ü§ñ **Explainable AI** ‚Äî LLM outputs are interpretable, auditable, and medically grounded.  

Potential use cases:
- Digital coaching and insulin dosing assistants  
- Automated therapy review tools for clinicians  
- Adaptive learning systems for diabetes management platforms

## üß≠ Impact and Vision

This work lays the foundation for a new generation of **safe, data-driven decision systems** in diabetes care ‚Äî combining **AI reasoning** with **physiological modeling** to create truly intelligent and reliable tools for clinicians and patients.
